# Architecture

Every human product has a story that run-up in front of it. That story is the architecture of that product.

# The story that run-up in front of Framework2

OOP coding is nonlinear storytelling. It is an event-driven story. Every event is a small story with actors and happenings. That small story in coding we call class.  The run-time of application is a playground for objects that have instantiated from the classes. 

A class is constructed of members and methods.
OOP is based on four pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. 
Here we used two of them. Abstraction here means that we coding a class with private and public members and methods. An object has been instantiated from that class show to other objects only public members and methods. Private members and methods are unknown outside or we can say are an abstraction to outside. 
Encapsulation is like a snail. He carries everything of his own with him. An object is a capsule with all members and the methods it needs. There is no borrowing between objects.

Because of the above, I started coding CRUD for the table menu in the folder admin. It was the beginning and end of my hard coding job. After that my job was copy/paste/change/clean that code in folders root and comments. In folder root, I need only READ from copied CRUD. Super. I clear others. In folder comment, for table comments, I need all CRUD. That's all. Simple isn't it.

Here I used MVC - Model, View, the Control flow of data. JQuery Ajax splits HTML from PHP and brings data asynchrony.

One page I named template goes ahead and rests all the time in the browser. It is View. Depend on our choosing links, JQuery Ajax script call PHP object - Control - which calls connection object and model object, connect to the database, query table, and by the same path bring data back in HTML inside the template.
Because the browser contains the same page, but navigation means different peaches in that page, the browsers do not see navigation but only one page, we call application like that SPA - single page application.
